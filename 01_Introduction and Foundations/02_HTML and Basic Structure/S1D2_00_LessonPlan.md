## 🔵 W – Welcome

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Greet students at the door with a smile.
- Post a “This or That” question: **"Website or App?"** on the board/projector.
- Take attendance by noting which one students choose when greeted by name.

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond to the warm-up question and get settled at their computers.

**Purpose:**
- SEL-driven rapport builder and attendance tracking in one.
- Smooth transition into class expectations and focus.

## 🟢 A – Aim

**Objective (posted and read aloud):**  
> *By the end of today’s class, you will be able to identify and write a valid HTML5 page skeleton using the basic structural tags: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.*

**Connection to broader unit:**
- This forms the foundation for everything we build on the web. Understanding structure is step one before applying style or interactivity.

**Monitoring:**
- Check for inclusion of required elements in student code and use questioning during instruction.

---

## 🟡 R – Review

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask review questions from Day 01:
  - What is web design?
  - What do all websites need to work?
- Transition into how HTML is the “bones” of a website.

**Student’s Role:**
- Participate in rapid-fire review discussion.
- Share what they remember about the purpose of web pages.

**Modification Strategy:**
- If students are unsure, show a few examples of websites with and without structure using Chrome DevTools.

## 🟠 R – Relevant Instruction

**Activity: HTML Structure Intro and Demo (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Explain each structural tag using slides and whiteboard (if applicable):
  - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - `<html>`
  - `<head>`
  - `<body>`
- Use a code-along model in WebStorm to demonstrate creating an HTML page from scratch.
- Emphasize indentation and syntax.

**Instructional Methods:**
☑ Mini-lesson  
☑ Guided notes (printed or digital)  
☑ Modeling/demonstration  
☑ Partner talk  

**Opportunities to Respond:**
1. Ask students: “Where do you think the visible content should go?” → pair share.
2. Students label blank HTML skeleton on printed worksheet before coding.

**Differentiation:**
- Scaffold: Provide a pre-labeled skeleton for students who need extra support.
- Enrich: Allow early finishers to add a `<title>` and test it in browser tab.

## 🔴 I – Interactive

**Activity: Guided Creation in WebStorm (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Walk students step-by-step through typing and saving the HTML file in WebStorm.
- Ask live comprehension questions:
  - “Why does this go in the `<head>`?”
  - “What would happen if we left this out?”

**Student’s Role:**
- Type along, saving and opening their HTML page in a browser.
- Ask clarifying questions and help peers troubleshoot.

**Fun Element:**
- Insert “HELLO WORLD” inside `<body>` and challenge students to change the color using inline style or emoji.

## 🟣 O – Ownership

**Activity: HTML Mini-Skeleton Challenge (15 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Assign independent task:
  - Create an HTML file with correct structure and a custom welcome message inside the `<body>`.
- Circulate and provide support.

**Student’s Role:**
- Work independently in WebStorm.
- Customize message and structure.

**Student Voice/Choice:**
- Students choose their welcome text.
- Optional challenge: Add a `<title>` and open in browser.

**Family/Community Connection:**
- Encourage students to show their first web page to a family member tonight.

## 🟤 R – Resonate

**Activity: Exit Ticket (5 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Distribute or post digital exit ticket questions:
  1. What do all HTML pages start with?
  2. What does the `<body>` tag contain?

**Student’s Role:**
- Complete and submit exit ticket.
- Share takeaways with a partner.

**Assessment:**
- Review exit ticket answers for understanding of structural tags.
