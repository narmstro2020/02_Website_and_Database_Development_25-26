# HTML Guided Notes: Basic Page Structure

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard language for creating web pages.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your Title Here</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Your content here.
  </body>
</html>
```

### Tag Descriptions:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Tells the browser you're using HTML5.
- `<html>`: Wraps the entire HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information like the title and links to stylesheets.
- `<title>`: Sets the name that appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains all content visible on the page.

## Notes
- Tags usually come in pairs: `<tagname> ... </tagname>`
- Indentation improves readability.
- The browser ignores whitespace but it helps humans.

## Sketch or Label:
Label the parts of this HTML page:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Label Me!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
