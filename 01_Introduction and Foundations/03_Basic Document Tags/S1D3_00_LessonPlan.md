## 🔵 W – Welcome

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Greet students and ask a question on the board:  
  **“Do you prefer texting or calling?”**
- Use answers to take attendance and make informal connections.

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond with "Text" or "Call" and settle at their computers.

**Purpose:**
- Warm up the class and encourage comfort with the concept of *text*.

---

## 🟢 A – Aim

**Objective (posted and read aloud):**  
> *By the end of today’s class, you will be able to use and explain basic HTML text elements including headings, paragraphs, emphasis tags, and line breaks.*

**Connection to broader unit:**
- Text formatting is the basis for communicating meaning and structure on the web.

**Monitoring:**
- Look for correct tag use in student work and check comprehension questions.

---

## 🟡 R – Review

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask: “What tags did we learn yesterday?”
- Display a blank HTML skeleton and ask for volunteers to fill in the missing tags.

**Student’s Role:**
- Answer verbally or write on the whiteboard/projector.
- Rebuild yesterday’s structure as a class.

**Modification Strategy:**
- If many struggle, provide a pre-filled structure and review tag locations together.

## 🟠 R – Relevant Instruction

**Activity: Direct Teaching & Modeling (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Introduce the new tags:
  - `<h1>` to `<h6>` (headings from most to least important)
  - `<p>` (paragraph)
  - `<strong>` (bold), `<em>` (italic)
  - `<br>` (line break)
- Demonstrate each in WebStorm and show how they look in the browser.
- Discuss semantic meaning: not just visual appearance.

**Instructional Methods:**
☑ Mini-lesson  
☑ Modeling/demonstration  
☑ Guided notes  
☑ Visual aids  
☑ Partner discussion

**Opportunities to Respond:**
1. Ask students to predict heading size order before demo.
2. Turn-and-talk: “What’s the difference between `<br>` and `<p>`?”

**Differentiation:**
- Scaffold: Provide a guided example with blanks to fill in.
- Enrich: Ask advanced students to nest `<em>` inside `<strong>`.

## 🔴 I – Interactive

**Activity: Code-Along Practice Page (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Guide students in typing a practice page using all new tags.
- Encourage use of personal text (favorite quote, poem, etc.)
- Answer questions and monitor understanding.

**Student’s Role:**
- Create a structured page using at least one of each tag:
  - Headings
  - Paragraphs
  - Emphasis
  - Line breaks

**Fun Element:**
- Add a "digital poem" using `<br>` for line breaks.

## 🟣 O – Ownership

**Activity: Personal Web Page (15 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Instruct students to modify their code to reflect their identity or interests using today’s tags.

**Student’s Role:**
- Create a mini "About Me" HTML page using all tags learned.
- Include their name in `<h1>`, hobbies in `<p>`, emphasize key words.

**Student Voice/Choice:**
- Choose topic and content for their own page.
- Add `<strong>` or `<em>` for stylistic effect.

## 🟤 R – Resonate

**Activity: Exit Ticket + Peer Share (6 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Distribute or display quick prompts:
  1. Name two heading tags.
  2. How do you make text italic?
  3. What does `<br>` do?
- Facilitate peer share-out of favorite tag learned.

**Student’s Role:**
- Submit answers and share one use case with a peer.

**Assessment:**
- Collect and review responses to assess understanding.
