- At least **2 paragraphs** (`<p>`)
- At least **1 instance of `<strong>` and `<em>`**
- At least **1 line break (`<br>`)**
- A page title in the `<title>` tag

### 🎨 Theme Options (choose one):
- A short biography about yourself
- A "Top 5 Favorites" list (music, food, movies, etc.)

<p>This is <strong>really <em>important</em></strong>.</p>
```
