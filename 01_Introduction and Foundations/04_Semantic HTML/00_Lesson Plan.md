## 🔵 W – Welcome

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Greet students and display the warm-up question:  
  **“What section comes first on most websites?”**
- Record answers during attendance.

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond: “Header,” “Menu,” “Logo,” etc.

**Purpose:**
- Activate prior knowledge and connect to real-world site structure.

---

## 🟢 A – Aim

**Objective (posted and read aloud):**  
> *By the end of today’s class, you will be able to define and use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to structure a webpage.*

**Connection to broader unit:**
- Helps improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of code.

**Monitoring:**
- Observe use of semantic elements in student code.
- Check understanding through questioning and peer discussion.

---

## 🟡 R – Review

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask: “Which tags have we used to display text?”
- On board/projector: Review difference between `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<br>`

**Student’s Role:**
- Answer questions and correct any tag misuse from past lessons.

**Modification Strategy:**
- Display a faulty/non-semantic HTML example and ask students how to improve it.

## 🟠 R – Relevant Instruction

**Activity: Direct Teaching of Semantic Elements (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Explain purpose of semantic HTML:
  - Enhances structure for screen readers and search engines
  - Makes code more understandable
- Teach the elements:
  - `<header>` – introductory content (logo, site title)
  - `<footer>` – bottom of the page (contact info, copyright)
  - `<nav>` – site navigation menus
  - `<main>` – primary content
  - `<section>` – groups of related content
  - `<article>` – self-contained content, e.g., blog post

**Instructional Methods:**
☑ Direct instruction  
☑ Live coding in WebStorm  
☑ Guided notes  
☑ Anchor chart  
☑ Class Q&A

**Opportunities to Respond:**
1. “Which tag would you use for a navigation menu?”
2. “Why would a `<div>` be less useful than `<section>`?”

**Differentiation:**
- Scaffold with a labeled semantic HTML chart.
- Enrich with ARIA role discussion for advanced learners.

## 🔴 I – Interactive

**Activity: Guided Semantic Web Page Build (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Model creation of a simple semantic layout in WebStorm.
- Guide students to replicate structure and modify content.

**Student’s Role:**
- Build a semantic layout using:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`
- Add headings and dummy content inside each tag.

**Fun Element:**
- Themed page: “My Favorite Movie” or “My Dream Vacation” using semantic structure.

---

## 🟣 O – Ownership

**Activity: Personalized Semantic Structure (15 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Prompt students to modify their code to reflect their personality or topic of interest.

**Student’s Role:**
- Create a semantic HTML page based on their interests (e.g., sports, art, music).
- Use all 6 tags correctly.

**Student Voice/Choice:**
- Pick the topic and write content to fill out semantic areas.

**Community Connection:**
- Encourage students to ask family members what they find confusing about websites and use that to inform layout.

---

## 🟤 R – Resonate

**Activity: Exit Ticket + Share Out (6 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask students to answer:
  1. What does “semantic” mean in web design?
  2. Which semantic tag was easiest to understand? Hardest?
- Facilitate brief partner discussion.

**Student’s Role:**
- Submit written or digital exit ticket.
- Discuss with peers what each tag does.

**Assessment:**
- Review accuracy of responses and correct use of semantic tags in code.
