## 🔵 W – Welcome

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Greet students with the warm-up question:  
  **“What’s the first website you visit every day?”**
- Use responses for attendance and informal check-in.

**Student’s Role:**
- Answer the question and settle at their computers.

**Purpose:**
- Connect HTML learning to real-world navigation and site structure.

---

## 🟢 A – Aim

**Objective (posted and read aloud):**  
> *By the end of today’s class, you will be able to create ordered and unordered lists using HTML and link to internal and external pages using anchor tags.*

**Connection to broader unit:**
- Lists and links are core features of nearly every website.

**Monitoring:**
- Check whether students use proper tag hierarchy and structure during coding activity.

---

## 🟡 R – Review

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask: “Which tags do we use for main content and sections?”
- Revisit: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` structure

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond to questions and identify where links might fit within prior layouts.

**Modification Strategy:**
- Display past work and highlight a section where a list or link could be added.

---

## 🟠 R – Relevant Instruction

**Activity: Teach Lists and Links (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Explain:
  - `<ul>` – unordered list
  - `<ol>` – ordered list
  - `<li>` – list item
  - `<a href="URL">Link text</a>` – link to external or internal content
  - Anchor with ID + internal linking: `<a href="#section1">Jump</a>`, `<div id="section1">`

- Demonstrate how to:
  - Create navigation with `<ul>` + links
  - Create a table of contents with anchors

**Instructional Methods:**
☑ Mini-lesson  
☑ Modeling and code-along  
☑ Guided notes  
☑ Visual breakdown of tag relationships

**Opportunities to Respond:**
1. “When would you use an ordered list?”
2. “What does `href` stand for?”

**Differentiation:**
- Scaffold: Provide prewritten list items students can convert to HTML.
- Enrich: Link to multiple sections on the same page.

## 🔴 I – Interactive

**Activity: Navigation Menu with Lists and Links (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Walk through creating a basic navigation menu using:
  - Unordered list of links
  - Internal anchors and external pages
- Display result in browser and inspect links

**Student’s Role:**
- Code along to build a webpage with:
  - A list of 3+ items
  - 1 link to an external website
  - 1 link to an internal anchor

**Fun Element:**
- Link the page to itself in a “Back to Top” anchor.

---

## 🟣 O – Ownership

**Activity: Create Your Own List Page (15 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Assign students to choose a topic and create a web page with:
  - Either a `<ul>` or `<ol>` list
  - An external link (e.g., to a YouTube video or article)
  - A working internal anchor link

**Student’s Role:**
- Choose a theme (Top 5 Movies, My Weekend Plan, etc.)
- Build a stylized page with links and lists

**Student Voice/Choice:**
- Choose content and structure
- Optional styling with inline CSS for flair

**Community Connection:**
- Encourage students to link to a resource their family uses often (school, sports, etc.)

---

## 🟤 R – Resonate

**Activity: Exit Ticket + Partner Check (6 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask:
  1. What’s the difference between `<ul>` and `<ol>`?
  2. What does `href` do?
- Partner review: students click each other’s links and give feedback

**Student’s Role:**
- Answer the two reflection questions
- Peer check a partner’s links and anchors

**Assessment:**
- Exit ticket and working demo of list + link on page
