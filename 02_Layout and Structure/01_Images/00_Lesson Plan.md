## 🔵 W – Welcome

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask: **“What’s your favorite image or meme right now?”**
- Call on a few students and build rapport while taking attendance.

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond with an image type, memory, or reference they enjoy.

**Purpose:**
- Connect HTML image tag to students’ real-world digital habits.

---

## 🟢 A – Aim

**Objective (posted and read aloud):**  
> *By the end of today’s class, you will be able to insert images into a webpage using the `<img>` tag and modify them using key attributes: `alt`, `title`, `width`, and `height`.*

**Why this matters:**
- Images bring life to content and support visual communication on the web.

**Monitoring Progress:**
- Check student code for correct syntax and presence of required attributes.

---

## 🟡 R – Review

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Ask: “What does the `<a>` tag do? How do we format an anchor?”
- Review key terms: `href`, `id`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`

**Student’s Role:**
- Answer review questions and connect new material to site navigation.

**Modification Strategy:**
- Display student code from the previous lesson and identify where an image would make sense to insert.

---

## 🟠 R – Relevant Instruction

**Activity: Teach `<img>` Tag + Attributes (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Explain:
  - `<img>` is a self-closing tag
  - `src` = source of the image (URL or local file path)
  - `alt` = description for screen readers and load failure
  - `title` = tooltip text
  - `width` / `height` = dimensions (pixels or %)
- Show examples of valid and invalid image syntax
- Demonstrate image resizing and styling basics

**Instructional Methods:**
☑ Mini-lesson  
☑ Live coding demo  
☑ Anchor chart / diagram of attributes  
☑ Peer examples

**Opportunities to Respond:**
1. Ask: “Why is the `alt` attribute important?”
2. Challenge: “What happens if an image fails to load?”

**Differentiation:**
- Scaffold: Provide example with blank attributes to fill in
- Enrich: Allow students to explore using width in % or CSS inline styles

---

## 🔴 I – Interactive

**Activity: Code-Along Image Insertion (25 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Walk students through:
  1. Adding an online image via `src`
  2. Changing size and adding `alt`/`title`
  3. Inserting a second image from local folder
- Show preview in browser and troubleshoot together

**Student’s Role:**
- Follow along in WebStorm or code editor
- Insert 2 images and format them with all 4 key attributes

**Fun Element:**
- Add a silly or personalized image and title text that appears on hover

---

## 🟣 O – Ownership

**Activity: Build an Image Gallery Page (15 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Challenge students to build a small “Gallery Page” with at least 3 images

**Student’s Role:**
- Create HTML page with:
  - At least 3 unique `<img>` tags
  - Meaningful `alt` and `title` attributes
  - Adjusted width/height

**Student Voice/Choice:**
- Choose the theme of the gallery (pets, memes, hobbies, food, travel, etc.)

**Community Connection:**
- Encourage students to share one image or meme with a family member tonight and explain the tags

---

## 🟤 R – Resonate

**Activity: Exit Ticket + Share Out (6 mins)**

**Teacher’s Role:**
- Post questions:
  1. What does `alt` do and why is it important?
  2. What happens if the image path is incorrect?
  3. Which attribute controls size?

**Student’s Role:**
- Respond in writing or via digital form
- Share their favorite image from today with a peer

**Assessment:**
- Review gallery code and exit ticket responses for understanding
